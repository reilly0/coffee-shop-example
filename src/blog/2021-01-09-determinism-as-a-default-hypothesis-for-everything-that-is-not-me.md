title: Determinism As A Default Hypothesis For Everything That Is Not ME

From the phenomenological point of view, I stand in the middle of a deterministic world; I choose my actions based on the counterfactuals that I think are true ... "If I do this, then that will happen", and "If I do that, then the other will happen".  The idea that counterfactuals can't have useful truth conditions in a deterministic world is therefore, on the very face of it, flat out unusable by us as a working hypothesis in our own lives.  Nor are we, wondering whether there are causally inaccessible possible worlds, or anything of the sort.  We are doing a little bit of science, and we are avoiding the externalizing interpretation; we are making an abstraction, and abstraction that supports exactly one counterfactual, the one we are interested in, and then asking the question, is that anonymous abstraction, one for which I don't have a name (though I could give it one, particularly if it keeps showing up), but for which I have combinatorial tools in the language to specify through the use of other, named abstractions ... is that abstraction manifested in an instance, right here and now?  If so, then true, and so enters into part of my reasoning, if not, not.
