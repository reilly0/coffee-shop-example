But, thinking of an external world, "the last smoke of an evaporating reality", as the "real world", and the world of our experience as some kind of ineffficacious wake left behind by the invisible ship that is our passage through reality, is only a condition of the problem, the problem of having no genuine agency in the world.  I don't see how you can attribute meaning to anything you do, if nothing you do is ... something you do.  Events might have meaning to you personally, in the sense that you like or dislike them, but you can't participate in a purpose, and have meaning in that sense if you, you know, can't choose to devote your efforts to this purpose over that purpose.
