I'm not sure if 'Modern Nihism' is the name I want to use for this concept of a kind of nihilism cause by acceptance of the view that there is an external world, it's nothing like the world of our experience, and that we ... omg ... "hallucinate" conscious reality.  Does one begin by pointing out that, in the ensuing elenchus, if we pursue that line of thought, the word 'hallucinate' will have no purchase for use in the incoherent idea that the "deep in the zone" neurologist is trying to present?
