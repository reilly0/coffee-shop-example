And this is just the first one.  But we are going to put a fair amount of text here to get an ideal of just what this excerpt function, .... "excerpts".  We will talk of many things, for example how the critique of the metaphysics of presence, forcefully, if confusingly pushed by Rorty, Davidson, Sellars, and others deep in the analytic cum pragmatic tradition, leads back to phenomenology, although no one seems to want to realize it and we go on doing philosophy of science like Platonists.
