This will of course bring us around to the revisability of logic itself, and Dummett's stunning views on the matter.  This will allow us to come in with some sharp analytical tools to address the casual content splattered all over the netverse, "Is Time Real?", "What is matter really anyway", and so on and so forth.  Of course these answers are simply based on taking current physics for the final word on the constraints of thinking about the structure of something, and then applying the externalizing interpretation.  Which is why we can never stitch it back into the essential role that time plays in our phenomenology, and therefore the real world, the real world of our experience, rather than the bookkeeping world of our current technical incantations.  

We shall turn to Dummet, not perhaps as an authority, but for at least one plausible answer to, what could you possibly mean by saying that this is real, and that is not?  We can start with Santa, realize that we're asking a very different question, and realized how hard to put into words, just what that question is.
