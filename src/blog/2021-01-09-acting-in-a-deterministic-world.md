If I don't treat the world as deterministic, then I can't act.  But if I can't treat myself as non-deterministic, then I can't act either, my actions will have no meaning.  If I did not choose, whether on the basis of reasons, weighed, in the final analysis by my insight-from-the-abyss, or sheer whim, live, direct-from-the-abyss, then the action is not mine, it has no reflection on the choices of someone who "experienced this, knew that, and chose to do this particular thing in consequence."  It's not important that I do it for reasons, or no reasons, it's important that I do it.  But of course we will now have to look closely at the notion of "I" being required here.  More phenomenology on the way.
